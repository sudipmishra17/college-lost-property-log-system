**SRS-Document-for-Aachilecture-College-Lost-Property-Management-System**


I prepared a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, as a part of my graduate course DAT709 – The IT Professional Capstone, guided by Dr. Ayesha Sohail. This SRS document refers to various college lost property management systems, web applications, and similar administrative tools.

The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Architecture: College Lost Property Management System” software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of the system. It will also explain system constraints, interfaces, and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval.

About Architecture – College Lost Property Management System:
Architecture is a web-based system designed to help colleges manage lost and found property efficiently. College staff can log found items, students can search for items and submit claim requests, and administrators can manage and approve claims. The system also includes automatic archiving of items older than 90 days.

Importance of Software Requirements
Software requirements establish the agreement between our team and the customer on what the application is supposed to do. Without a description of what features will be included and details on how the features will work, the users of the software can’t determine if the software will meet their needs. The importance of requirements really spans across the entire team. Without any documented requirements, many assumptions are made during the development and testing phase. Developers and designers claim poorly functioning features are that way by design, and in general, things slip through the cracks.

Key contents in the document:
•	Functional Requirements / Non-Functional Requirements for the application
•	Product Features
•	Use Case Diagram
•	Use Case Descriptions
•	Data Flow Diagrams
•	Sequence Diagrams
•	Class Diagrams

Conclusion:
This document deals with the importance of gathering requirements and provides key assistance for software development and design. This SRS document depicts the key software engineering practices related to requirements gathering and requirements engineering. This SRS document can be used for software development methodologies – Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, etc.
